# Team Project Improvement
- I modified a lot of the "FRONT-END" and "BACK-END" of the [team-project](https://github.com/junwoo0823/team-project).

## Features
- "FRONT-END" change.
- Add board recommendation, reply, comment button.
- Apply "[WYSIWYG editor](http://suneditor.com/)" to the text area.

## Review
- I revised the team project I worked on before by myself, but it took time because there were so many problems. Although it is not 100% perfect, I think the results are satisfactory enough.
